Shadertoy Path tracerSupported features: Multiple importance sampling, clean primitive definition, BRDF importance sampling. Basic PT MIS PT Disney BRDF OpenGL Compute Shader based path tracerSince I have done quite a bit learning on path tracing algorithms and materials (the hardest parts are MIS, NEE, the theory for NEE and MIS is not very difficult, but when it comes to implementationâ€¦ðŸ˜­), I want to extend the shader Iâ€™ve created into a working rendering engine. I watched some tutorials on OpenGL compute shader and port my ShaderToy Shader to it. Also, there is much more care that needs to be taken other than rendering itself, for example, camera system, mesh I/O, material system, sampling system, data transport between CPU and GPU, etc. So, the overall routine takes about half a month to complete. The code needs to be refactored for further optimization and extension (the microfacet brdf model has not yet been integrated into it).
